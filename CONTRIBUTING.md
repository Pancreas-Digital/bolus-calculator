# Reporting Issues

Just use github issues. Verify the issue not exist first.

### Please try to provide as much information as possible when raising an issue:

- If it is a bug, please try to explain how to reproduce it, roughly which settings you are using, what you are seeing or not seeing. Screenshots welcomed.
- If it relates to a new feature, please explain the rationale for the feature, use cases and detail your suggestion.

# Contributing patches

### Do you have an idea for a feature or enhancement or bugfix?

Patches are welcomed! Following the roadmap is much appreciated.

# Translations

Translations are very welcomed. We already implemented i18n which is [supported out-of-the-box by NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing) (thanks @sedusa). We added support to es-AR (default locale) and en-US.
